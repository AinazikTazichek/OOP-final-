# Unirom
University Management System developed in JavaFX.
<hr>

## Basic Introduction
This is my university semester project. This software is developed in JavaFX language and I use MySQL for databases. This application is basically used to handle university tasks. For example, Teacher upload marks, attendance etc, and students can view marks, attendance. Student has also options to register the courses, see the full study plan of different semesters. He also can view his/her fee details of registered courses. Students can also see his/her transcript. There is an admin who handles the overall process. Admin can add new Students also can add new Faculty members and assign him a course. Admin can also add new courses and can delete existing courses. All the tasks I mentioned above are implemented in this application. Though this is my semester project so it is as much as perfect. Because in semesters we have limited time to submit iterations and final working product. So here are some clicks of my application.
